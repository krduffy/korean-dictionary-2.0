way too many listeners registered. on every dispatch the effects refire so scrolling can
register upwards of 500
make instances of listeners not be registered in the case that the hook already has
one with that set of args or make it so the effect conditionally registers them

logging in does not invalidate everything on the page
need new api data change event that clears most of the cache on login or logout
+ calls loadedDataChanged on the panels
some things like find lemma are not login status contingent and can therefore be kept

arrows in word origin look weird when origin is to the left of word (get rid of entirely in db?)
